# Collab Editor SPM Project - V1.0 (Stable)

This project is a real-time collaborative text editor built with ASP.NET Core and SignalR. This is the stable `v1.0` release.

## V2.0 Development Plan (Post-Rollback)

Development on `v2.0` was halted due to technical challenges. The project has been rolled back to its stable `v1.0` state. The plan is to re-approach the **User Authentication** and **Multi-Document Support** features in a future sprint after a technical review.
